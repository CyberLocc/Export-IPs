# Project Setup

### A Simple Bash Script to Setup for a Box/Project.

It all started with S1ren's idea of using export to set environment variables for $IP and $URL. Initially, I aimed to create a straightforward script to export these variables along with the Attack Box IP. However, I soon realized the potential to expand upon this concept.

A significant portion of my workflow involves organizing notes, outputs from various tools, and other data into specific folders. This requires creating directories, exporting essential IPs, and occasionally modifying the hosts file.

You might think, "Adding a folder for Nmap output or creating directories isn't difficult. These are just small, repetitive tasks that take seconds." Yet, as these tasks accumulate, they consume more time, introduce errors, and can turn minutes into hours.

So, I pondered, why not automate these repetitive tasks? Why not create a script that captures crucial variables, persists them throughout my session, and handles the repetitive work? With such a script, my notes could utilize these variables, eliminating the need to manually type paths or IPsâ€”well, at least significantly reducing it.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. I hope you find value in it and perhaps even suggest additional features to enhance its utility. After all, it's an ongoing endeavor aimed at minimizing wasted time.
